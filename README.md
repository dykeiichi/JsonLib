# JsonLib

## Summary

This project is a personal implementation for training my c# skills and to have a way to use Json Objects with compatibility with AOT compilation

## Goals

* Make a really fast implementation to read and write JSON Objects
* Reduce the memory allocated in the heap
* Reduce the time that it takes to process

## Desired

* Make an easy implementation to serialize/deserialize Objects with generic functions
